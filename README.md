# LearningProgress-R

Reporting for my learning progress

I think that one of my responsibilities as a developer is to keep my knowledge up to date in all areas that I need for my languages and technologies of choice.

To achieve that I am using several learning portals on the internet which offer different information about my learning progress and my knowledge.

Some time ago I started to create a dashboard so I'd have an overview about how much there is still to do. And here are the R files for that, including my little shell script that I can execute every now and then to publish my current status easily here:

## Get up and running

To get up and running yourself just 

  - open the R-Project within the Source folder. 
  - copy the Config.Sample.R as Config.R and change the config information to your accounts
  - there is a Dashboard.Rmd which is the main entry point. 

I left you with my personal configuration which points to my public profiles, which is where that information is coming from, so you have something to look at and from there you can decide where to go.

CodeSchool.R and TeamTreehouse.R and hopefully soon more little libraries do what you'd think of them: They offer functions to easily retrieve information from the same-named portals.
